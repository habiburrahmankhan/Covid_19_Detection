# Detecting COVID-19 with Chest X-Ray
### [demo frontend ](https://habiburrahmankhan.github.io/Covid_19_Detection/)
As we already know, testing is one of the most important steps towards inhibiting the spread of Covid-19. 
Even though a lot of work has already been done on Covid-19 detection using Chest X-rays, we need a more accurate and efficient model to detect Covid cases.
### we also use GradCam 
---
#### To achieve higher accuracy in the detection of Covid-19 using Chest X-rays, the following model was used: 
###### We used Transfer Learning approach to train the following models:
> Densenet201

> InceptionV3


> Resnet50V2


* An ensemble model, consisting of the three models, is created.
* According to the accuracy yielded by the models individually, weights were assigned to ensemble model.

### Data Description 
The dataset used for the project consists:
1. Chest X-ray images of COVID-19 patients: 3600 images
2. Chest X-ray images of other patients and healthy people: 3600 images
* For training, we used 2800 Covid +ve images and 2800 Covid –ve images.
* For validation, we used 400 Covid +ve images and 400 Covid –ve images
* For validation, we used 400 Covid +ve images and 400 Covid –ve images

[The source of the dataset is:](https://www.kaggle.com/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database)

## Dataset Preparation 
* The images are divided into three distinct groups: one for training, one for validation and another for testing.
* All images are resized to 224x224.
* The images as well as their labels are converted into a numpy array.

## Training the model

* All three models (Densenet201, InceptionV3, Resnet50V2) were trained for 30 epochs.
* The value of patience was set to 10 epochs.
* After training all the model save to .h5

## folder information 
### DataPreparation_Script 
* this file code contsain datapreparation ( image to numpy )
### GUI 
#### A web based GUI was also created.  
#####  all the code contain in GUI folder 
* This will allow anyone to browse a chest X-ray image and upload it to the web application. The application will execute the ensembled model and classify the uploaded Chest X-Ray image.
